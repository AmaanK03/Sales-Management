## Data Cleansing & Transformation (SQL)

To create the necessary data model for doing analysis and fulfilling the business needs defined in the user stories, the following tables were extracted using SQL.

One data source (sales budgets) was provided in Excel format and was connected in the data model in a later step of the process.

Below are the SQL statements for cleansing and transforming the necessary data.
